# **Beryllium - Performance Optimization Modpack**

*Beryllium* is a Fabric-based optimization modpack created as a foundation for future modpacks by **Nexium**. Developed by an amateur modder, *Beryllium* draws heavy inspiration from the renowned *Adrenaline* modpack, incorporating many of its configuration techniques to enhance Minecraft’s performance—improving FPS, reducing lag, and speeding up load times. With 23 carefully chosen mods focused purely on optimization, *Beryllium* serves as a flexible base for players and modpack creators to build upon.

## **Key Features:**

- **Inspired by Adrenaline**:  
  *Beryllium* borrows directly from the advanced configuration settings of the *Adrenaline* modpack. By taking its expertly-tuned optimizations, *Beryllium* delivers a similar performance boost to enhance gameplay stability and FPS. Even though it’s developed by an amateur, the configuration benefits from proven methods used in *Adrenaline* for an optimal experience.

- **Customizable Foundation**:  
  Designed as a base for future modpacks, *Beryllium* is fully customizable. While the default configuration boosts performance out of the box, users can easily modify it to suit their specific needs, whether by adjusting settings, adding mods, or personalizing gameplay features.

- **Pre-Configured Performance Tweaks**:  
  The modpack includes complex performance tweaks inspired by *Adrenaline*, which most players may struggle to configure on their own. These pre-configured settings fine-tune Minecraft’s engine for better FPS, faster load times, and smoother gameplay without requiring expert-level knowledge.

- **Automatic Optimization Enforcement**:  
  To ensure stability and maintain peak performance, *Beryllium* includes mods that enforce its optimizations automatically. This allows the user to jump straight into Minecraft with no need to manually tweak settings while still benefiting from the optimizations taken from *Adrenaline*.

- **Fabric Modloader**:  
  Powered by Fabric, *Beryllium* is built for lightweight performance and fast updates, making it easier to extend with additional mods and compatible with a wide range of system specifications.

- **Nexium's Foundation for Future Modpacks**:  
  As the first modpack in the **Nexium** lineup, *Beryllium* serves as a solid performance-optimized foundation that future modpacks from the organization will be built upon. It’s a flexible starting point that emphasizes stability and efficiency.
